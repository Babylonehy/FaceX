# Basel Face Model 2017

Please download the data from the following link:

https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/bfm2017/restricted/model2017-1_bfm_nomouth.h5 (original Basel Face Model mask)

https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/bfm2017/restricted/model2017-1_face12_nomouth.h5 (Model cropped to the face region)



The Basel Face Model 2017 is available in the Statismo (https://github.com/statismo/statismo) file format used by the Scalable Image Analysis and Shape Modelling Software Scalismo (https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo).

A tool to view the model can be downloaded under https://github.com/unibas-gravis/basel-face-model-viewer

For model based face image analysis you can use our model adaptation framework Scalismo-faces (https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces).

To get started with our software we prepared tutorials (http://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/PMM/).

For our precomputed radiance transfer tutorials you can download the supplied material here:

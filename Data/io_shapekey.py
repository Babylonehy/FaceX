import bpy
from os.path import join

# Reference the active object
o = bpy.context.active_object 

# CHANGE THIS to the folder you want to save your OBJ files in
# NOTE: no spaces, no trailing slash
exportPath = "/home/lyn/Downloads/" 

# Reset all shape keys to 0 (skipping the Basis shape on index 0
for skblock in o.data.shape_keys.key_blocks[1:]:
    skblock.value = 0

# Iterate over shape key blocks and save each as an OBJ file
for skblock in o.data.shape_keys.key_blocks[1:]:
    skblock.value = 1.0  # Set shape key value to max

    # Set OBJ file path and Export OBJ
    objFileName = skblock.name + ".obj" # File name = shapekey name
    objPath = join( exportPath, objFileName )
    bpy.ops.export_scene.obj( filepath = objPath, use_selection = True, global_scale = 1 )

    skblock.value = 0 # Reset shape key value to 0

# THE END

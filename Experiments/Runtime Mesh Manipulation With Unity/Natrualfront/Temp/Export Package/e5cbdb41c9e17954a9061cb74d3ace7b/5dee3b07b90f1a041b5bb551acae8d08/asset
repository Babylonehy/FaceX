<h2>New to this version</h2>
<p>Improvements: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Improve UI </li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>The animation will be successful the first time and every time, without any manual intervention from you. This is <strong>drastically different from conventional trial-and-error</strong> that is unavoidably caused by rigging and creating morph targets. </li>
<li>The unique 1-Click Animation technology enables you to <strong>instantly</strong> get animation you want, <strong>without any need for rigging, morphing, key-framing or motion capture</strong>. All you need to do is one-mouse-click. </li>
<li>Since the technology is patented and NaturalFront is currently the only patent assignee, the substantial benefits cannot be found in any other legal software.</li>
</ul>

<p>This software allows professionals, freelancers, hobbyists and beginners to create high-quality 3D facial animation in a tiny fraction of time and cost that would be needed by using other software, since the plugin uses a highly innovative technology. 
    By using the new technology, studios, freelancers and beginners can <strong>substantially save the cost and shorten the time</strong> for creating high-quality expressive 3D characters, and, by doing so, enjoy a substantial competitive edge.

<p>More importantly, once a 3D-head is successfully created, you can <strong>instantly get expressions and mouth-shapes you want</strong>, and blend them together, all by a few simple mouse-clicks, <strong>without any need for low-level chores</strong>, such as rigging, morphing, key-framing.</p>
<p>The whole process is so intuitive and simple that it is <strong>no more difficult than getting your own face generate expressions and talk</strong>.</p>
<br>

<h1>How It Works?</h1>

<h2>Start the plugin</h2>

<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Window</strong> menu option in Unity.</li>
<li>Click <strong>NaturalFront 3D Facial Animation Plugin Pro</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="1.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>
<br>

<h2>Photo-to-3D modeling</h2>
<p>A 3D-face-model will be created, and the 3D-model will resemble the person on the photo, including both geometry and texture. The process should only take a few seconds on a reasonable 64-bit PC. </p>
<p>Once the 3D-face-model is created, the model will automatically have customized high-quality 3D-animation built-in. </p>
<h3>Important Note:   </h3>
<ul>
<li>For fast modeling, the size of the face-photo is an important factor, besides the computing power of your computer. </li>
<li>Smaller sizes will lead to faster creation, but larger sizes can create more detailed textures, assuming the face takes the majority of a photo. </li>
<li>The recommended size is around 1000 pixels * 1000 pixels. </li>
<li>It is up to users to decide if they want to resize the photo, before photo-to-3D modeling.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h3>Start modeling</h3>

<p>Click the first icon <strong>Generate 3D models from photo</strong> to start an <strong>intuitive process </strong>that gets you realistic custom-built 3D heads with all the animation you want, with a few mouse-clicks, all within Unity.</p>

<h2 id="animation_proc">Animate the 3D-face</h2>
<p>The created 3D head has on average a few thousand vertices. This density has proved to be good for all sorts of facial expressions and mouth shapes.</p>

<h3>Add a primary expression</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select a primary expression for a 3D face: <strong>Neutral, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Fear, Anger or Disgust</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the strength of the primary expression using the slider.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Moving the slider will automatically change the pose at the expression-level, <strong>without any low-level manual intervention from you</strong>, such as rigging or creating morph targets.</p>
<br>

<h3>Add a mouth-shape</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Mouth</strong> to set up a mouth-shape.</li>
<li>Click High-Level.</li>
<li>Set <strong>Lip narrow &ndash; Wide</strong> value using the slider.</li>
<li>Set <strong>Jaw Close &ndash; Open</strong> value using the slider.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Moving the slider will automatically change the mouth shape, <strong>without any low-level manual intervention from you</strong>, such as rigging or creating morph targets. If the model already has an expression set, the mouth shape will automatically blend with that expression.</p>
<p><img src="6.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>
<br>

<h3>Set abstraction levels</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click the third icon <strong>Change level of control</strong>, or, Click <strong>Animation</strong> in the plugin menu and select <strong>Level of control</strong>.</li>
<li>Selecting <strong>Abstract level</strong> enables you to quickly coordinate the animation of the whole face. Or,</li>
<li>Selecting <strong>Fine-control level</strong> enables you to separately animate the eye-area and the mouth-area, which gives you more freedom in what you want the 3D model to do. </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="7.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>
<br>

<h4>Fine-control level: Set Brows</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Brows</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Movements</strong>.</li>
<li>Select a movement option: <strong>Brow Mid-Up</strong>, <strong>Brow Mid-Down</strong> or <strong>Brow Out Up</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the strength of the movement using the slider.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="8.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>
<br>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Moving the slider will automatically animate the eye-area according to your desired effect, <strong>without any low-level manual intervention from you</strong>, such as rigging or creating morph targets.</p>
<br>

<h4>Fine-control Level: Set Mouth</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Mouth</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Muscles</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Neutral</strong>, <strong>Happiness</strong>, <strong>Sadness</strong>, <strong>Surprise</strong>, <strong>Fear</strong>, <strong>Anger</strong> or <strong>Disgust</strong>. These are essentially all the muscles you have on your mouth area! </li>
<li>Set the strength of the muscle movement using the slider.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li> Expressions are used to name the muscles, because some professionals prefer not use anatomical names that are more accurate but less user-friendly. </li>
<li> Moving the slider will automatically animate the mouth-area according to your desired effect, without any low-level manual intervention from you, such as rigging or creating morph targets. </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Synchronization of animation and audio</h2>

<h3>Load and play audio</h3>

<ol>
<li>Click the second icon <strong>Load audio</strong>, or, Click <strong>Media</strong> in the plugin menu and select <strong>Load audio</strong>.</li>

<ol>
<li><a href="#animation_proc"> Set the model to a desired pose </a> at this key-position. </li>
<li>Once you are satisfied with the pose, click<strong> Save Key</strong> button at the bottom-left, to save the pose into this key.</li>
<p><img src="11.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>
</ol>
<br>
<p><strong>Note: A pose will only appear in the final animation if it is saved into a key. </strong> </p>
<br>

<h3>Delete a saved key</h3>
<p>You can right click any saved key, and choose "Delete selected key", to delete the pose saved at this keyframe.  </p>
<p><img src="Delete_key.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: black"></p>

<h1>Pros &amp; Cons</h1>
<p>NaturalFront&rsquo;s unique philosophy is to make as simple as possible the task of the traditionally time-consuming and costly 3D-face-animation, and at the same time, the animation will be professional-quality.</p>
<p>These are the key benefits of using NaturalFront 3D Facial Animation plugin:</p>
<p>- Super-fast modeling and animation</p>
<p>- Substantial time-saver</p>
<p>- Substantially cost-effective</p>
<p>- High-quality and customized 3D models and animation can run anywhere via FBX files. </p>
<p>Since a user can achieve high-quality 3D modeling and animation without any low-level tasks such as rigging or creating morph targets, the saving of time and cost will be truly <strong>substantial</strong>, in contrast to <em>marginal saving</em> that a user might get used to and/or expected, prior to trying the plugin.</p>
<br>

<p>Limitations of the current version:</p>
<ul>
<li>this version only works on Windows Operating System.</li>
<li>only models and animates 3D heads, instead of complete 3D characters;</li>
<li>only models and animates realistic human 3D heads, i.e. animals and unrealistic/fancy characters are not included;</li>
<li>the current version focus on 3D modeling and animation, i.e. 2D is not currently supported;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we believe that, the benefits far outweigh the limitations.</p>

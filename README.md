# Project Description

This project aims to construct a facial image synthetic data engine in Unity (FaceX) similar to existing PersonX and VehicleX datasets to be usable for person Re-ID, emotion recognition, age/gender recognition etc. 

For developing synthetic face emotion dataset, writing a literature survey is the first step to know more detail about this project, and then the preliminary list of steps are as following:  

    * i.	learn Unity, and find face models / tools to construct face models (eg naturalfront.com); 

    * ii.	construct sufficient face identities with variations and generate a large synthetic data set;

    * iii.	implement an architecture from literature to compare results of synthetic and real training.

    * iv.	Develop an approach with appropriate trade-offs of properties.

If time permits use some tools to include functionality to modify face adornments (hats, glasses etc).

Finally, delivering a report.

First of all, I want to thank to my supervisor Tom. I was not sure at the beginning what kind of project I wanted to complete, and in what form my project was presented. Tom gave me many project options. This allowed me to choose this project when I had no idea. In the process of project development, because I am not very familiar with the field, especially unity. Tom gave me a lot of knowledge about software and project progress ideas. At the same time, I was given the channels and methods for obtaining relevant data sets. Evaluate the progress of my project through weekly meetings. At the same time, I answered the problems in my project. Secondly, I want to thank the other students in the laboratory. Actually, the progress of my project is not very smooth. I took a lot of detours and didn't find the right direction until the last few weeks. In this process, the other seniors  in the laboratory also gave me great help. Xiaoxiao will explain the content of my project so that I can go deeper into this field faster. At the same time, she answered the questions I asked patiently, even though some of them seemed very silly. I am very grateful to Xiaoxiao for helping me with this project and correcting me in time when I make detours. Other students in the laboratory also helped me a lot in this process. I am very grateful to them. Especially because of the epidemic, I can only communicate online and remotely. They always help me when I need them. Finally, I want to thank my parents and my fiancee. It was they who gave me a lot of spiritual help, and helped me ease my mood when I was depressed and stressed. At the same time, they take great care of me in life so that I can devote myself to learning.

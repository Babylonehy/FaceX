- A Morphable Model For The Synthesis Of 3D Faces
  
  Starting from  an example  set  of  3D  face  models,  we derive  amorphable face model by transforming the shape and texture of theexamples into a vector space representation. New faces and expres-sions can be modeled by forming linear combinations of the proto-types.  Shape and texture constraints derived from the statistics of our example faces are used to guide manual modeling or automatedmatching algorithms.
